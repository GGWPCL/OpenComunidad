# OpenComunidad

OpenComunidad is a community management platform built during a hackathon that enables neighborhoods and residential communities to better organize, communicate, and make collective decisions.

## üèÜ Hackathon Project

This project was built during Platanus Hack 24 with the goal of optimizing real estate investments through better community management. By fostering healthier, more organized communities, the platform helps:
- Reduce vacancy rates through improved resident satisfaction
- Increase rent retention by building stronger community bonds
- Lower operational costs via efficient communication
- Minimize risks through better community oversight and decision-making

While built in a short time frame, we aimed to create a foundation that benefits both property investors and residents alike.
